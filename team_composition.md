## Roles and Positions

Dota 2 teams consist of five players with distinct roles based on farm priority (Position 1-5):

### Position 1 (Carry)
- Primary late-game damage dealer
- Scales well with items (e.g., Anti-Mage, Spectre)
- Requires farm and protection early game
- Team's primary win condition in late game

### Position 2 (Midlaner)
- Tempo controller with mid-game peak
- Provides mix of damage and playmaking
- Examples: Storm Spirit, Queen of Pain
- Often creates space for Position 1

### Position 3 (Offlaner)
- Durable initiator or utility hero
- Frontline presence and fight disruption
- Examples: Tidehunter, Axe
- Enables teamfights through CC or tankiness

### Position 4 (Soft Support)
- Roaming or greedy support
- Early-game impact focus
- Examples: Earth Spirit, Tusk
- Provides CC or kill setup

### Position 5 (Hard Support)
- Protective support
- Vision and ally preservation focus
- Examples: Oracle, Dazzle
- Prioritizes team utility over personal farm

## Key Aspects of Team Composition

### Scaling
- **Early-Game Focus**: Heroes like Chen, Undying, Night Stalker
- **Mid-Game Focus**: Heroes like Puck, Leshrac
- **Late-Game Focus**: Heroes like Medusa, Phantom Lancer

#### Importance of Balance
- Early-game focus risks falling off late
- Late-game focus risks early game vulnerability
- Mixed scaling provides flexibility

### Teamfight Potential

#### Key Elements
- Area-of-effect (AoE) damage
- Crowd Control (CC)
- Buffs/Debuffs

#### Notable Examples
- Wombo-combo ultimates (Tidehunter + Magnus)
- Sustained damage compositions (Jakiro + Venomancer)

### Crowd Control (CC)

#### Types
- Single-target (Lion's Hex)
- AoE (Faceless Void's Chronosphere)
- Soft CC (Venomancer's Gale)

#### Strategic Value
- Essential for kill setup
- Disrupts enemy combinations
- Protects core heroes

### Damage Mix

#### Physical Damage
- Right-click focused heroes
- Scales with attack items
- Examples: Phantom Assassin, Ursa

#### Magical Damage
- Spell-based burst or sustained damage
- Examples: Zeus, Lina
- Countered by magic resistance

### Tower Pushing

#### Key Components
- Building damage specialists (Pugna, Death Prophet)
- Summon-based pushers (Lycan)
- Support elements (Beastmaster aura)

### Frontline Presence

#### Characteristics
- Damage absorption
- Engagement initiation
- Examples: Bristleback, Centaur Warrunner

### Chase Potential

#### Important Features
- Mobility skills
- Catch potential
- Examples: Spirit Breaker, Windranger

## Synergy and Strategy

### Strategic Archetypes

#### Deathball (Push/Teamfight)
- Early grouping
- Tower focus
- Examples: Death Prophet, Jakiro, Underlord

#### Split-Push
- Lane pressure
- Map control
- Examples: Nature's Prophet, Tinker

#### Pick-Off
- Isolation tactics
- Roaming focus
- Examples: Night Stalker, Bounty Hunter

#### Late-Game Scaling
- Defensive early game
- Resource accumulation
- Examples: Spectre, Invoker, Medusa

### Notable Synergies
- Magnus + Sven (AoE physical damage combo)
- Shadow Demon + Mirana (Pick-off setup)

## Drafting Considerations

### Key Factors
1. Enemy counterpicks
2. Lane matchups
3. Draft flexibility
4. Item build adaptation

### Strategic Elements
- Early pick flexibility
- Counter-pick opportunities
- Lane strength assessment
- Power spike timing

## Example Compositions

### Balanced Team Example
- **Pos 1**: Faceless Void (Carry, Teamfight)
- **Pos 2**: Queen of Pain (Magical Damage, Mobility)
- **Pos 3**: Centaur Warrunner (Frontline, Initiation)
- **Pos 4**: Tusk (Roam, CC)
- **Pos 5**: Jakiro (Push, Control)

### Composition Analysis
- Mixed damage types
- Strong teamfight presence
- Multiple CC options
- Clear power spikes
- Balanced scaling

## Common Pitfalls

### Draft Mistakes to Avoid
1. Overemphasis on late game
2. Insufficient waveclear
3. Poor vision control
4. Mismatched timing windows
5. Single damage type focus

### Risk Mitigation
- Balance power spikes
- Ensure role coverage
- Maintain damage diversity
- Consider lane matchups
- Plan vision control

## Conclusion

Successful team composition in Dota 2 requires careful balance of multiple factors:
- Role distribution
- Power spike timing
- Damage diversity
- Strategic clarity
- Counter-pick awareness

The key to drafting lies in understanding both team synergies and enemy vulnerabilities while maintaining flexibility in execution options.
