# Next Steps for Hero Data and ML Model Development

## Current Status

We have successfully created:

1. A structured JSON schema for hero abilities
2. Individual JSON files for 33 heroes with placeholder ability data
3. Complete ability data for several key heroes (Axe, Invoker, Rubick, Enigma)
4. A combined JSON file containing all hero data

## Required Tasks

### 1. Complete Hero Data

The most immediate task is to populate the remaining hero JSON files with accurate ability data. Focus on:

- Correct ability names and descriptions
- Accurate special values (damage, durations, etc.)
- Proper classification of ability types and behaviors
- Identifying which abilities pierce spell immunity

### 2. ML Model Development

Once we have comprehensive hero data, we can begin developing the ML model:

#### 2.1. Feature Engineering

- Extract relevant features from ability descriptions
- Create numerical representations of abilities based on their effects
- Develop a classification system for ability types (stun, slow, nuke, etc.)
- Build a system to identify synergies between abilities

#### 2.2. Model Architecture

- Implement an embedding layer to convert hero and ability data into vectors
- Create a neural network that can predict synergies and counters
- Develop a similarity-based system for hero recommendations
- Implement a team composition analyzer based on ability classifications

#### 2.3. Training Data

- Collect match data containing hero picks, bans, and win rates
- Create a dataset of known hero synergies and counters
- Generate a training set for ability classifications

#### 2.4. Deployment and Integration

- Integrate the ML model with the Java application
- Implement real-time inference during draft phase
- Create an explanation system for recommendations

## Implementation Plan

1. First iteration: Complete hero data for at least 40 popular heroes
2. Second iteration: Create a basic pattern-matching system for ability classification
3. Third iteration: Implement a simple ML model based on pre-classified abilities
4. Fourth iteration: Enhance the model with real match data and feedback
5. Final iteration: Integrate Groq LPU for real-time inference and natural language explanations
