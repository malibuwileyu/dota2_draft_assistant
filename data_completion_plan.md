# Dota 2 Hero Abilities Data Completion Plan

## Completed Tasks

1. **Data Structure Design**
   - Created standardized JSON schema for hero abilities
   - Included fields for name, description, type, behavior, special values, etc.
   - Added support for innate abilities

2. **Data Generation Scripts**
   - Created manual template generator (`manual_hero_ability_creator.py`)
   - Expanded generator to support all heroes (`expand_heroes.py`)
   - Created data combiner to generate the unified file (`combine_all_heroes.py`)

3. **Hero Coverage**
   - Generated templates for 36+ heroes
   - Manually populated ability data for key heroes (Axe, Crystal Maiden, Shadow Fiend, Enigma)
   - Combined all hero data into a comprehensive file (`all_heroes_abilities.json`)

## Next Steps

1. **Data Completion**
   - Complete ability data for all remaining hero templates
   - Add accurate special values for abilities (damage, duration, etc.)
   - Update innate abilities for heroes that have them
   - Verify accuracy of existing data against game mechanics

2. **Data Enhancement**
   - Add tags for abilities (e.g., "stun", "slow", "nuke", "disable")
   - Enhance descriptions with more relevant game mechanics information
   - Improve special_values to capture all important ability parameters

3. **ML Model Integration**
   - Begin designing ML model that uses ability data to identify synergies
   - Create feature extraction methods to convert ability descriptions to vectors
   - Develop classification scheme for ability types and interactions

## Specific Hero Templates to Complete First

These heroes have high priority for data completion due to their mechanical depth:

1. Invoker (10 spells plus orb combinations)
2. Rubick (interaction with other heroes' spells)
3. Morphling (attribute shift and morphing mechanics)
4. Earth Spirit (complex stone remnant mechanics)
5. Oracle (complex spell interactions)
6. Dark Willow (multiple ability components)
7. Io (tether and relocate interactions)
8. Chen (creep control mechanics)
9. Meepo (clone management)
10. Arc Warden (tempest double mechanics)

## Data Verification Approach

For each hero:
1. Check ability names against official Dota 2 documentation
2. Verify spell mechanics details on Liquipedia or Dota 2 Wiki
3. Test special values against in-game numbers
4. Review interaction mechanics for accuracy
5. Update the JSON files with accurate information
6. Run the combiner to refresh the all_heroes_abilities.json file
